-------------------------------------------------------------------Incremental detection of text inconsistencies in big data--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction : Incremental detection of text inconsistencies in big data involves continuously monitoring and identifying discrepancies or anomalies in real-time data streams. This method ensures data integrity without overwhelming the system with large-scale batch processing. A solution includes using machine learning algorithms like anomaly detection or Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and flag inconsistencies as new data is ingested.

Problem Statement: The problem is to efficiently detect and address inconsistencies, errors, or anomalies in large-scale, continuously flowing text data in real-time, while maintaining system performance and minimizing the processing load. Traditional batch processing methods are inadequate for handling dynamic, rapidly changing data streams, requiring more scalable and responsive solutions.
